Kaa open-source IoT platform [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kaaproject/kaa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kaaproject/kaa)
============================

Kaa is a production-ready, multi-purpose middleware platform for building complete end-to-end IoT solutions, connected applications, and smart products. The Kaa platform provides an open, feature-rich toolkit for the IoT product development and thus dramatically reduces associated cost, risks, and time-to-market. For a quick start, Kaa offers a set of out-of-the-box enterprise-grade IoT features that can be easily plugged in and used to implement a large majority of the IoT use cases.
