Welcome to the Kaa community!

As an open-source project, [Kaa platform]({{root_url}}Glossary/#kaa-platform) thrives from contributions by people like you.
We would love to see you mastering the Kaa source code; however, writing code is not the only way you can contribute to Kaa.

Feel free to use all of the contribution options:

- Join [Kaa Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kaa) to find answers to common user questions, ask your own Kaa-related questions, and help others in the community.
- Use [Jira](http://jira.kaaproject.org/browse/KAA/) to provide feedback, make features and functionality suggestions, and help other community members.
When reporting bugs, issues, and other problems you have come across using Kaa, please make sure you provide as much detail as possible so that the reported issue can be resolved effectively.
- Contribute to Kaa project on [GitHub](https://github.com/kaaproject/kaa).

## Improve documentation

Documentation is a part of the Kaa code base.
You can find the documentation files in the `doc/` subdirectory of the [main repository](https://github.com/kaaproject/kaa).
That means that the contribution process is the same for both the source code and documentation.
See [Documentation contribution guide]({{root_url}}Customization-guide/How-to-contribute/Contribution-guide/).
