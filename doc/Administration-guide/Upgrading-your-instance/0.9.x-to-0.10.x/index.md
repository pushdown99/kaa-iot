Follow these steps to run the upgrade script:

1. Go to your Kaa host machine.
2. Download the [upgradeKaa090to0100.sh]({{github_url_raw}}server/upgrade/data-migration-0.9.0-0.10.0/src/main/resources/scripts/upgradeKaa090to0100.sh) and [data-migration_0.9.0-0.10.0.jar](http://repository.kaaproject.org/repository/releases/org/kaaproject/kaa/server/upgrade/data-migration/0.10.0/data-migration_0.9.0-0.10.0.jar) to upgrade the databases.
3. Download the Kaa 0.10.x debian package at [Download Kaa](http://www.kaaproject.org/download-kaa/) page.
4. Ensure that the files downloaded in steps 2 and 3 above are located in the same directory.
5. Execute the command below:

```bash
 sudo ./upgradeKaa090to0100.sh
```

>**IMPORTANT:** During the installation of the Debian package, the script may ask you to resolve conflicts in the /usr/lib/kaa-node/conf/ folder.
>Be careful when merging configurations as incorrect server settings can cause malfunction of the Kaa server.
