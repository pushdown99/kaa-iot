Welcome to the Kaa IoT platform documentation!

Kaa is a highly flexible, multi-purpose, 100% open-source middleware platform for implementing complete end-to-end IoT solutions, connected applications, and smart products.
For a quick start, Kaa offers a set of out-of-the-box enterprise-grade IoT features that can be easily plugged in and used to implement a large majority of the IoT use cases.
The platform features include device management, data collection, configuration management, messaging, and more.
See [Key platform features]({{root_url}}Programming-guide/Key-platform-features/) section for details.

>**NOTE:**
>If you are looking for documentation for Kaa versions prior to 0.10.0, please follow [this link](http://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Kaa+IoT+Platform+Home).
