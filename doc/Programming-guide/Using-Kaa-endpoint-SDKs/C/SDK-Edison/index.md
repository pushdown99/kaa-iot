The guide provides information on how to **cross-compile** C SDK for Intel Edison.
Alternatively, you can build the Kaa C endpoint SDK right on the Edison board.
Refer to [the Linux guide]({{root_url}}Programming-guide/Using-Kaa-endpoint-SDKs/C/SDK-Linux/) for further details.

**Verified against:**

 - **Host OS:** Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit LTS
 - **Target OS:** Poky (Yocto Project Reference Distro) 1.7.3

# Install dependencies

**The further instructions must be executed on the host machine.**

1. Download the [cross compile tools](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/24472/Cross-Compiler-Toolchain-for-Intel-Edison-Maker-Board) for your platform, 32 or 64 bit. Untar the downloaded file (don't forget to change the file name to proper one).

        tar -xvf edison-toolchain-20150120-linux64.tar.bz2

2. Install toolchain.

        cd i686
        ./install_script.sh

    You may experience `find: invalid mode '+111'` error message while running the installation script. The script can be fixed with this command:

        sed -i 's:+111:/111:' install_script.sh

    The cross compilation toolchain is installed to `/opt/poky-edison/1.6.1/` directory by default. On some configurations the script installs the toolchain only to its working directory.

# Create application

Now, dependencies are installed and it is time to create Kaa application.
Since Edison is running Linux, you can refer to [the Linux guide]({{root_url}}Programming-guide/Using-Kaa-endpoint-SDKs/C/SDK-Linux/#c-sdk-build) for detailed process of application creation.
But remember, you must specify correct compiler when compiling your Kaa application for Intel Edison:

        export EDISON_CC=/opt/poky-edison/1.6.1/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/bin/i586-poky-linux/i586-poky-linux-gcc
        cmake -DKAA_MAX_LOG_LEVEL=3 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$EDISON_CC ..
        make 

For more details on how to build, upload and run your application on Edison board, you may refer to official [user guide](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-edison-board-user-guide).
